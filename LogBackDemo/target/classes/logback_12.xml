  <!-- 
  	LOCAL SCOPE	 : A property with local scope exists from the point of its definition in a configuration file until the end of interpretation/execution of said configuration file. As a corollary, each time a configuration file is parsed and executed, variables in local scope are defined anew.

	CONTEXT SCOPE: A property with context scope is inserted into the context and lasts as long as the context or until it is cleared. Once defined, a property in context scope is part of the context. As such, it is available in all logging events, including those sent to remote hosts via serialization.

	SYSTEM SCOPE : A property with system scope is inserted into the JVM's system properties and lasts as long as the JVM or until it is cleared.
